# cisc275-f21-examples
Example code from CISC275 Fall 2021 semester

If we do something interesting in class, I'll try to keep it here. Feel free to make Pull Requests and add stuff, or even raise Issues, I suppose!

## Week 2

I created an example *basic* portfolio. I wouldn't say it demonstrates too much, but it gives the format of what I would do when I get started: https://github.com/acbart/My-275-011-Example-Portfolio

I created an example site for the 010 section: https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-010

I created an example site for the 011 section: https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-011

## Week 3

I have started a webapp in React and TypeScript, it will be for a TA Training Game I use:
